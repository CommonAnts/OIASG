# OIASG
An OIer's Adventure-Strategy Game Engine

OIASG is an light,simple and naive game engine for adventure-strategy games with events(and can be used for plots),tech trees and exams.

The engine users works with python and APIs in a subnamespace of the game.

It also has a default GUI and basic OI strategy systems for the certain game project:"OI Diary"(a temporary call).

## about development

OIASG is based on python 3 and [pyglet](http://pyglet.org/).

We use modified(mainly debugging) pyglet 1.3.1 for windows.You can get the modifications form `/pyglet`.

**The game is chiefly for Windows 10,so it may not work well on other platforms(but this is not normal).**

**Note that pyglet uses AVBin to decode medias.**
